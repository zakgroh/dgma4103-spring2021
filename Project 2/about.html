          <p>Hello there! I'm Zak and as you may have guessed, this is my webpage! I'm currently in my 2nd year at Alfred State and I am 19 years old. I'm going to school for Digital Media and Animation. I hope to one day work for Marvel Studios and help bring to life all my favorite characters and stories. To piggyback off of this, I love quite a few of nerdy things; and with no shame! I love Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Pixar, you name it! When I'm not rewatching a Marvel movie for the 50th time, you can find me either reading, gaming, or doing school work.</p>

          <p>Currently, I'm reading through <em>The Two Towers</em> by J.R.R. Tolkien. After finishing this, I plan to move on to the third and final part of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy. Aside from the occasional novel, I mostly read graphic novels; Im currently reading my way through Eric Kripke's <em>The Boys</em> series. Graphic Novels are some of my favorite media because on top of getting a kick-ass story, you also get kick-ass art to go with it. Over quarantine, I read a vast amount of graphic novels including Joshua Williams' run of <em>The Flash</em> and Tim Sale's <em>The Long Halloween</em>. As of 2021, the most recent graphic novel I read was <em>The Vision</em> by Tom King!</p>

          <p>If you were to observe an ordinary day in my life, you would find that about 50% of my days are spent gaming; whether it be on my PS4, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch. At most times, I'm usually playing more than one game at a time. I just recently finished both <em>Resident Evil 3 and 7</em> and <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>. Currently, I'm playing my way through <em>Super Mario 3D World</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> for the second time; <em>Red Dead 2</em> is one of those games that really resonated with me similiar to <em>The Last of Us: Part 2</em>. Gaming is one of my hobbies that I can do almost whenever and still be entertained with it. I view videogames as playable movies in some ways; with my extreme love of cinema, I'm sure you can see the appeal to videogames.</p>
