          <p>For about the first month of the quarantine that began in March/April of 2020, I had not left my house at all; only to let my dog out and to get the mail. This picture was taken the first time I left my house. This was also the time when masks were in short supply, so i had to improvise and use an old t-shirt of mine. Fast-forward to today, and i have a 50 pack of disposable masks, a handful of washsable/reusable masks, and hand sanitizer wherever I go. Oh how the times change!</p>
