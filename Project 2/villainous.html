          <p>Villainous is a game that I had played a handful of times prior to COVID-19. Before the Marvel version was released in July of 2020, the only other Villainous games were Disney themed; they were/are still just as fun! I introduced this game to my girlfriend during the pandemic and it quickly became a staple of our quarantine. The objective of the game varies depending on who you play as; each character has a different objective (for example, Thanos' objective is to collect all six Infinity Stones). You can play the game with a minimum of 2 people and a maximum of however many characters you have for the game (there are various expansion packs for the Disney version). Similar to Monopoly, this game can and will create tension among players and "ruin" friendships. This image is from the day that my girlfriend and I went to Target to pick up the game.</p>
