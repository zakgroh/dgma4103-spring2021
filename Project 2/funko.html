          <p>Funko Pops are tiny little vinyl collectible figures. Today, you can find a Funko for almost any movie or TV show. The ones pictured here are two of my most recent ones, Mr.Mittens from Pixar's <em>Soul</em> and Darth Maul from <em>The Clone Wars: Season 7</em>. The seventh and final season of <em>The Clone Wars</em> was released during the bulk of quarantine. The last 4 episodes of the series is some of my all-time favorite <em>Star Wars</em> content; it features my 2 favorite characters, Darth Maul and Ahsoka Tano (a Funko Pop I have been searching WILDLY for) in the Siege of Mandalore and the start of Order 66. Mr.Mittens on the other hand is from what is quite possibly the most moving animated film I have ever seen; <em>Soul</em>. In the film, the cat, "Mr.Mittens", plays a big part. Becuase of this, and the fact that I love cats, I decided to get the Funko of Mr.Mittens. Today, he sits on my desk accompanying me with online classes and school work.</p>
