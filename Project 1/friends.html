          <p><em>The Boys</em> is a show that I was a fan of before COVID came along. However, the second season of the show aired its first episode in September 2020 and this was the season to make this show my absolute favorite. The show is about superheroes who belong to a corrupt company that do some very shady deeds. "The Boys" are the ones looking to keep the "Supes" under control. What I love most about the show is how it showcases a world of superheroes controlled by corporate greed. <em>The Boys</em> features many superheroes who are essentially carbon copies of other more mainstream heroes; for example, Homelander and Queen Maeve from <em>The Boys</em> are basically Superman and Wonder Woman. Not only is the show a unique spin on the superhero genre, it also does not hold back on any aspect of the show; whether it be controversial topics, extreme gore, language, or jokes. To me, this makes the show more bold than the average TV show.</p>
