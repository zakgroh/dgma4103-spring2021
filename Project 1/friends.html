    <h2><u><em>Me and the Gang</em></u></h2>
      <p>This is my friend group. From left to right we have Gabe, Kelly, me, Quinn, and Andrew. All except Gabe are in my major. Nothing beats hanging out with all of them; laughs always ensue. For my first semester at Alfred State, I never really hungout with people in my major because I would mostly keep to myslef. It wasn't till my second semester that I had actually started hanging out with the people I had a majority of my classes with. Although COVID is very socially restricting, we all still find time to hangout as a group.</p>
