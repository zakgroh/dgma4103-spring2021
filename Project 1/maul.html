          <p>For me, this tattoo signifies the start of the pandemic. I got this tattoo as a birthday present on the day prior to my actual birthday. When I got the tattoo, I was with 2 people aside from me and the tattoo artist and none of us had masks on. The day after i got the tattoo, my birthday, is when a majority of COVID quarantine protocols were installed. The tattoo is Darth Maul, a character from <em>Star Wars</em> who is among my favorites. To date, this is my largest tattoo. Before this one, I had two rather small tattoos. Since this one was significantly larger, getting it done was very different being that I was in the chair for way longer. To me, tattoos are an underrated form of art.</p>
