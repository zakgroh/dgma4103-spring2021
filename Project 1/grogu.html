    <h2><u><em>A More Recent Outing:</em></u></h2>
      <p>This is me in October of 2020. I chose to include this image to show the contrast to my very first outing during COVID. I like this picture because to me, it seems like controlled chaos. I have a mask on cause of COVID, all my bags packed to go home, and my stuffed Grogu strapped to my chest; in this moment I felt like a single dad who was just gettin by. The chaos of it all is controlled because to me, this photo was completely normal and even less chaotic to me than my first quarantine outing; in that image, the chaos comes from all the uncertainty and freshness of the situation.</p>
