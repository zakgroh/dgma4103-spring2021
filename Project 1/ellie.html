          <p><em>The Last of Us: Part 2</em> was one of my most anticipated games of 2020. After playing the first game, it quickly became my favotite game. When the second installment in the series was delayed due to COVID, I was very disappointed; solely because I was so hype for the game. On release day, I woke up bright and early, drove to the nearest Target, and bought the game. I was there so early the game wasn't even stocked yet; that's how excited I was. The game itself is one of 2020's most controversial game releases due to the direction and story of the game. Despite the backlash the game recieved, I still loved everything about it. Today, I would say that this game is one of my favorites which is a bold statement to make in the gaming community. Of all the video games I played over the quarantine, none of them resonated with me as much as <em>The Last of Us: Part 2.</em> This image was captured using a photo mode feature in the game.</p>
