          <p>This is the second tattoo I got during COVID. For all of quarantine, the one main obsession I had was <em>Star Wars</em>. This obsession carried over past the bulk of quarantine as well. Watching the second season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, I fell deeper into the abyss of my obsession. I've always known that I wanted multiple <em>Star Wars</em> tattoos, but I couldn't think of anything that really pushed me to go get another. This changed when I was hanging with one of my best friends, Shane, while watching a Bills game. We were discussing tattoos and then I suddenly thought of a tattoo idea (the one pictured). I love the <em>Star Wars</em> alphabet and how it looks like space-glyphs, and I had been wanting to do something involving my last name as well. The idea that came to me was my name is Aurabesch (<em>Star Wars</em> alphabet) with a symbol next to it. The symbol I chose was that of the Empire because of how much I love the sith and stormtroopers.</p>
