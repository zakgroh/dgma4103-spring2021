    <h2><u><em>The Pretty Side of my Pup</em></u></h2>
      <p>This is another image of my dog but it captures more of her "good girl" side. Every once in a while, when she stops acting like a silly maniac, a nice picture of her can be captured. This is one of my favorites solely because it reminds me of how much fun I had over the summer getting to be with my dog almost every day. One of our favorite activities when the weather is nice is to go outside and play with her ball. Since I live in a county where there are literally more cows than there are people, my backyard is a grwat length fro Bradni to run around in. Despite being on the older side, Brandi still displays a heavy amount of puppy-energy. When she isn't sleeping, she'll more than likely be trying to get me to play with her!</p>
