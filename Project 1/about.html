    <h2><em><u>"I'm just a simple man trying to make his way through the galaxy."-Boba Fett</u></em></h2>

      <p>Hello there! I'm Zak and as you may have guessed, this is my webpage! I'm currently in my 2nd year at Alfred State and I am 19 years old. I'm going to school for Digital Media and Animation. I hope to one day work for Marvel Studios and help bring to life all my favorite characters and stories. To piggyback off of this, I love quite a few of nerdy things; and with no shame! I love Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Pixar, you name it! When I'm not rewatching a Marvel movie for the 50th time, you can find me either reading, gaming, or doing school work. I love to read novels (fiction, mostly) and especially graphic novels. The current books I'm reading are <u>The Two Towers</u> by J.R.R. Tolkien and re-reading <u>Marvel's Civil War,</u> written by Mark Millar. When gaming, I can be playing almost anyting; it really depends on the day! I'm currently playing my way through Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil 3, Ultimate Alliance 3, and now Super Mario 3D World!</p>
