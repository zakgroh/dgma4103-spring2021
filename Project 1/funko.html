          <p>Funko Pops are tiny little vinyl collectible figures. Today, you can find a Funko for almost any movie or TV show. The ones pictured here are two of my most recent ones, Mr.Mittens from Pixar's <em>Soul</em> and Darth Maul from <em>The Clone Wars: Season 7</em>. The seventh and final season of <em>The Clone Wars</em> was released during the bulk of quarantine. The last 4 episodes of the series is some of my all-time favorite <em>Star Wars</em> content; it features my 2 favorite characters, Darth Maul and Ahsoka Tano (a Funko Pop I have been searching WILDLY for). Mr.Mittens on the other hand is from what is quite possibly the most moving animated film I have ever seen; <em>Soul</em>. In the film, the cat, "Mr.Mittens", plays a big part. Becuase of this, and the fact that I love cats, I decided to get the Funko of Mr.Mittens. Both Funkos signify 2 of my favorite pieces of media to me.</p>
