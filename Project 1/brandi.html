          <p>This is my pup Brandi. I've had her since the 3rd grade and she is the love of my life. During the quarantine, my brother and my dad were still working. So as I was home alone doing my online schooling, Brandi and I were the ones to keep each other company. One of our favorite activities was watching <em>The Mandalorian</em> every friday; she can't pick a favorite character, but she really loves Boba Fett! During this time of being with her for so long, I realized that she really is a huge part of my life and a dog that I love immensely. Brandi is the goofiest dog I've ever owned. Her nickname is <em>Schmooze</em> because whenever she is in trouble, she'll try and get out of it by schmoozing whoever yelled at her. I must say, it is a very effective move and works on me almost every time.</p>
