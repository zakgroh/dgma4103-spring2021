          <p>During the quarantine, I got an iPad Pro and the Procreate software. I had done many sketches and many other pieces, but none came to any full fruition. One that did, however, is the piece pictured below. Something that I've always loved to see in art is tentacles, because of how weird and alien-like they seem. I'd never drawn a tentacle, or even attempted one, so I wanted to try it out! I wanted the piece to be absurd, surreal, weird, etc. I chose to make the tentacle holding a blunt because I thought it effectively added to the weirdness I was going for. To go even further with the idea, I made the blunt-holding tentacle come out of a cloud of smoke with space in the center.</p>
